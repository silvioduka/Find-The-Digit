Create a program to find all the integer values between 0 and n, which contain the digit d. 

d is from the range 0 to 9. 

For Example: 

Input: n = 20, d = 5 

Output: 5, 15 

Input: n = 50, d = 2 

Output: 2, 12, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 32, 42. 

Bonus: You may extend the value of d to any integer value. 

For Example: 

Input: n = 300, d = 42 

Output: 42, 142, 242.
